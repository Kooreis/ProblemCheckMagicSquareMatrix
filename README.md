# Question: How do you check if a matrix is a magic square? C# Summary

The provided C# code checks if a given matrix is a magic square. A magic square is a square matrix, of size n x n, where the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and both main diagonals are the same. The code first defines a 2D array (matrix) and then calls the function `IsMagicSquare` to check if the matrix is a magic square. Inside the `IsMagicSquare` function, it first calculates the sum of the elements in the first row of the matrix, which is considered as the magic sum. Then, it checks if the sum of elements in each of the remaining rows, each column, and both diagonals are equal to the magic sum. If any of these sums are not equal to the magic sum, the function returns false, indicating that the matrix is not a magic square. If all sums are equal to the magic sum, the function returns true, indicating that the matrix is a magic square.

# Python Differences

The Python version of the solution uses a similar approach to the C# version to solve the problem. Both versions calculate the sum of the first row of the matrix and then compare this sum to the sum of each other row, each column, and the two diagonals. If any of these sums do not match the first sum, the function returns False, indicating that the matrix is not a magic square. If all sums match, the function returns True, indicating that the matrix is a magic square.

The main differences between the two versions are due to the differences in syntax and built-in functions between Python and C#. 

1. In Python, the sum of a list can be calculated using the built-in `sum` function, while in C#, the `Enumerable.Range` and `Sum` methods are used to achieve the same result.

2. Python uses list comprehension to calculate the sum of each column and the two diagonals, which is a more concise and Pythonic way to handle such operations. In contrast, C# uses for loops and the `Enumerable.Range` method to achieve the same result.

3. The Python version includes a `main` function that prompts the user to input the size of the matrix and each row of the matrix. The C# version, on the other hand, hardcodes the matrix in the code.

4. Python uses dynamic typing, so there's no need to declare the type of a variable when it's created. In contrast, C# is statically typed, so the type of each variable must be declared when it's created.

5. Python uses indentation to define blocks of code, while C# uses curly braces `{}`.

6. Python uses the `if __name__ == "__main__":` construct to allow or prevent parts of code from being run when the modules are imported. C# doesn't have an equivalent construct.

# Java Differences

The Java and C# versions of the solution are quite similar in their approach to solving the problem. Both versions check if a matrix is a magic square by comparing the sum of the elements in the rows, columns, and diagonals of the matrix. If all these sums are equal, the matrix is a magic square.

However, there are some differences in the way the two versions are implemented:

1. Input: In the C# version, the matrix is hardcoded into the program. In contrast, the Java version prompts the user to input the size of the matrix and its elements.

2. Sum Calculation: The C# version uses the Enumerable.Range and Sum methods to calculate the sum of the elements in the rows, columns, and diagonals. The Java version, on the other hand, uses nested for loops to calculate these sums.

3. Array Declaration: In C#, the matrix is declared as a 2D array using the syntax `int[,] matrix`. In Java, the matrix is declared as a 2D array using the syntax `int[][] matrix`.

4. Array Length: In C#, the length of the array (or the number of rows/columns in the matrix) is obtained using the GetLength method. In Java, the length of the array is obtained using the length property.

5. Console Output: In C#, the Console.WriteLine method is used to print output to the console. In Java, the System.out.println method is used for the same purpose.

6. Method Declaration: In C#, the method to check if the matrix is a magic square is declared as `static bool IsMagicSquare(int[,] matrix)`. In Java, the method is declared as `private static boolean isMagicSquare(int[][] matrix)`. The difference here is the use of `bool` vs `boolean` for the return type, and `private` access modifier in Java method.
